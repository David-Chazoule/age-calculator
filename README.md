## The challenge
Users should be able to:

View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
Receive validation errors if:
Any field is empty when the form is submitted
The day number is not between 1-31
The month number is not between 1-12
The year is in the future
The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Bonus: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted
